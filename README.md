# Odd or Even BruteForce Generator
A ridiculously over-the-top tool that generates brute force code to check if numbers are odd or even. Choose your favorite programming language (Python, Java, JavaScript, C, C++, C#, Assembly), specify the number range, and let the brute force magic happen. No logic is spared, just pure brute force in its finest form. Ideal for anyone who enjoys unnecessary complexity and a good laugh.
